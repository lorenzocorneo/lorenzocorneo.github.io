            <p>I am currently a PhD candidate at Uppsala University in
              Sweden. My research interests are broad but are mainly
              focused around anything that makes use of a network
              (wireless or wired). I received MSc. in distributed
              systems at KTH Stockholm, where I also worked as
              research assistant at NSLab lead
              by <a href="https://people.kth.se/~dejanko/">Prof. Dejan
              Kostic</a>. Furthermore, I also worked as research
              engineer at Ericsson Research in Stockholm Kista.</p>
              <p>At the beginning of my graduate studies I explored
              how to improve the quality of information delivered by
              Internet of Things systems with respect to smart
              factories and large-scale applications. This branch of
              research, achieved in cooperation with my supervisors
              <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~perg/">Prof. Per
              Gunningberg</a>
              and <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~chrohner/">Prof. Christian
              Rohner</a>, lead to high appreciation and publication in
              a top-tiered conference like IEEE INFOCOM and workshop
              co-located with the prestigious conference ACM PODC.</p>
            <p>In the second half of my PhD journey I visited and
            started collaboration with University of Helsinki
            at <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/collaborative-networking">CoNe
            group</a>, lead
            by <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/collaborative-networking/people">Prof. Jussi
            Kangasharju</a>. I then started investigating the real
            benefits that edge computing could bring to the end users,
            and how it differs from the canonical cloud computing
            paradigm. We are trying to do so by extensive Internet
            measurements through the whole world by
            using <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/"
            target="_blank">RIPE Atlas</a>
            and <a href="https://www.speedchecker.com/"
            target="_blank">Speedchecker</a>, that we warmly thank for
            their support. Our first measurements study will be
            published at ACM HotNets 2020. I additionally started
            collaboration with <a href="http://ambuj.se/">Dr. Ambuj
            Varshney</a> where we research ultra-low power backscatter
            system and our battery-free tunnel diode based carrier
            emitter work is to be published in the flagship conference
            for mobile computing ACM MobiCom 2020. </p>

                    Edge computing has gained attention from both
                    academia and industry by pursuing two significant
                    challenges: 1) moving latency critical services
                    closer to the users, 2) saving network bandwidth
                    by aggregating large flows before sending them to
                    the cloud. While the rationale appeared sound at
                    its inception almost a decade ago, several current
                    trends are impacting it. Clouds have spread
                    geographically reducing end-user latency, mobile
                    phones’ computing capabilities are improving, and
                    network bandwidth at the core keeps increasing. In
                    this paper, we scrutinize edge computing,
                    examining its outlook and future in the context of
                    these trends. We perform extensive client-to-cloud
                    measurements using RIPE Atlas, and show that
                    latency reduction as motivation for edge is not as
                    persuasive as once believed; for most applications
                    the cloud is already “close enough” for majority
                    of the world’s population. This implies that edge
                    computing may only be applicable for certain
                    application niches, as opposed to a
                    general-purpose solution.

                    Backscatter enables transmissions at orders of
                    magnitude lower energy consumption when compared
                    to conventional radio transmitters. Backscatter
                    tags achieve this by the reflection or absorption
                    of carrier signal generated from emitter
                    devices. However, backscatter systems are limited
                    by these emitter devices, as they are
                    significantly energy-expensive when compared to
                    the tags. While backscatter tags can operate
                    without requiring batteries, relying on the
                    minuscule amounts of energy harvested from the
                    ambient environment. However, the emitter devices,
                    are commonly tethered to an external power supply
                    or operate on large batteries.

                    We present Tunnel Emitter: a tunnel diode
                    oscillator based system that enables the
                    generation of carrier signals at a peak biasing
                    power of tens of uW. Thus, for the first time, it
                    allows battery-free emitter devices. The key
                    enabler to the design is a phenomenon exhibited by
                    tunnel diode oscillators that we call back
                    injection, and we are the first to
                    demonstrate. Back injection enables the emitter
                    devices to amplify (up to 20dB) and relay the
                    backscattered signal. Our results show that Tunnel
                    Emitter when operating together with a tag from
                    long-range backscatter system, facilitates
                    multi-floor communication. Tunnel Emitter, due to
                    the back injection phenomenon, achieves this with
                    a carrier signal that is orders of magnitude
                    weaker than used in state-of-the-art systems. We
                    believe Tunnel Emitter overcomes the key
                    constraint restricting backscatter systems and
                    thus can make backscatter systems ubiquitous.

                    We consider large scale Internet of Things
                    applications requesting data from physical
                    devices. We study the problem of timely
                    dissemination of sensor data towards applications
                    with freshness requirements by means of a
                    cache. We aim to minimize direct access to the
                    possibly battery powered physical devices, yet
                    improving Age of Information as a data freshness
                    metric. We propose an Age of Information-aware
                    scheduling policy for the physical device to push
                    sensor updates to the caches located in cloud data
                    centers. Such policy groups application requests
                    based on freshness thresholds, thereby reduces the
                    number of requests and threshold misses, and
                    accounts for delay variation. The policy is
                    incrementally introduced as we study its behavior
                    over ideal and more realistic communication links
                    with delay variation. We numerically evaluate the
                    proposed policy against a simple yet widely used
                    periodic schedule. We show that our informed
                    schedule outperforms the periodic schedule even
                    under high delay variations.

                    We study edge server support for multiple periodic
                    real-time applications located in different
                    clouds. The edge communicates both with sensor
                    devices over wireless sensor networks and with
                    applications over Internet type networks. The edge
                    caches sensor data and can respond to multiple
                    applications with different timing requirements to
                    the data. The purpose of caching is to reduce the
                    number of multiple direct accesses to the sensor
                    since sensor communication is very energy
                    expensive. However, the data will then age in the
                    cache and eventually become stale for some
                    application. A push update method and the concept
                    of age of information is used to schedule data
                    updates to the applications. An aging model for
                    periodic updates is derived. We propose that the
                    scheduling should take into account periodic
                    sensor updates, the differences in the periodic
                    application updates, the aging in the cache and
                    communication variance. By numerical analysis we
                    study the number of deadline misses for two
                    different scheduling policies with respect to
                    different periods.
